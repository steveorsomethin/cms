Be sure to run ./bootstrap.sh before proceeding.

Inline editing of rendered templates that affect backing data.
Media library available. Allow for drag drop of media to targets, such as images.
Inline sitemap editing and manipulation.
Typically, you can add fields to datatypes freely, but they aren't allowed to be mandatory. Consider retrofitting existing data with a default.
If you remove a field without updating the referencing template, crash occurs.
If our technology is front-end agnostic, how is query filtering handled?
WYSIWYG editor, pure js, front-end agnostic.
Problem: asp.net views are compiled. Evaluating a template at runtime is not feasible.

Need to think about blob storage. Images, movies, docs, etc.
Can use a message queue to have clean middleware for handling workflow, like order placements. Consider allowing handlers to be in the front end tech or as javascript.
Static content storage.
APIs:
	Sitemap - Binds to templates, simply acts as a backbone
	Media Blobs -
	Templates - Views, possibly technology dependent
	DocumentTypes - Existing
	Documents - Exsiting
	Static markup - Just html. Styles?
	Metadata - Can describe/attach to static markup or media blobs
	Profile - Who are you?
	Authorization - What can you do?

Problem: Managing partial views, for example razor
Consider using cloud9 for code editing
Focus on drag-drop, non-experts.
The things every manager wants, and never gets in a satisfactory manner: 
	Full data history
		Could use ZSETs pointing to hash maps with keys that changed, allowing "replay" in conjunction with snapshots.
		Could also use operational transformation with ZSETS
	Full knowledge of who did what and when
		Make it easy for someone creating a document type to say "track changes" and be done with it.
	Reporting
		Use a separate database which is notified of relevant data and report from that.
